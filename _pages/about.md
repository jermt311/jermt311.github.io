I aspire to be a Data Analyst. With a background in Chemical Engineering, I am currently completing my degree with a double major in Data Science and Business Analytics at the University of Sydney. I have had the opportunity to pursue my studies in 4 different countries to date, which has provided me with a global outlook in embracing diversity. I love collaborating with others on projects, feel free to reach out for a collaboration!
