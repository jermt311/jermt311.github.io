I aspire to be a Data Analyst. With a background in Chemical Engineering, I am currently completing my degree with a double major in Data Science and Business Analytics at the University of Sydney. As an aspiring data scientist, I have experience with Python, R and SQL programming. Most of my experience revolving around data wrangling and various machine learning techniques. I love collaborating with others on projects, feel free to reach out for a collaboration!
